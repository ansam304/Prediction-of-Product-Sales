### Business problem:

This project focuses on predicting the sales of food items in different stores. The goal is to help the retailer understand which product and store features affect sales the most. First, the data was cleaned by fixing missing values and errors. Then, visual tools like countplot and heatmaps were used to explore the data and find useful patterns. After understanding the data, a machine learning model was created to predict future sales.
